## Read and apply to the Code of Conduct

Most communities follow [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
for their Code of Conduct, which boils down to a couple of decorum rules:

- be kind and empathetic
- be respectful
- give and gracefully accept constructive feedback
- no public or private harrassment allowed in any form or kind
- no trolling, insulting and other kinds of attacks allowed

## Read and apply to the Contribution Guidelines

Most projects have a CONTRIBUTING file

Gives hints on what's required _before_ raising a pull request, usually stuff like:

- how to raise an issue
- how to set up development environment
- how to format and lint the code
- what testing to perform / how to run automatic tests 
- how to request review
